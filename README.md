# Belly Button Biodiversity

## Project Overview

Roza would like the partially finshed dashboard completed. Three charts displaying each volunteers' data will need to be created. One horizontal bar chart showing the top 10 bacterial species (OTUs), one bubble chart showing bacteria cultures per sample, and finally a gauge chart showing the weekly frequency of belly button washes.
